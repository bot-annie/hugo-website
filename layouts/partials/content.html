<p>We want to solve various problems encountered by plant collectors, botanists, and gardeners. Searching correct information about botany has been a pain for a long time because of all those false information on the internet and the difficulty to understand original research publications from academic journal. Here, we present a chatbot that utilize the open data certified by the professionals and experts from the public sectors to answer questions from general public who are interested in botany.</p>
